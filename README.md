# [Validation With Regex on React](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Javascript-Validation-With-Regex.md)

In this challenge, we create a validation form to validate the inputs entered by a user using RegEx.

For this project, there'd be three required inputs for validation:
- The first would require the user to enter five (5) capital letters, six (6) symbols and two hyphens (-) in any order. This could be used as a password.
- The second which could be used as username would require the user to enter letters without spaces
- The third which could be used as email address would require the user to enter only email addresses on gmail (...@gmail.com).

## User Stories

-   [ ] User should be notified of any invalid inputs by error messages displayed on the form.
-   [ ] The submit button on the form would never be executed until all entries are validated.
